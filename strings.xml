    \n\nIndications:	Extreme heat; if with thirst, high fever it can be Yangming heat or internal heat. If surging and forceless, this is Xu surging.
    \n\nEtiology:	This pulse has been said to arrive strong at the chi position and depart at the cun position, thus its wave like character. The Yang is floating excess and upward, this is a manifestation of fire floating upward and water drying internally(i.e. loss of blood, diarrhea)
    </item>
        <item>
    Ge Mai (Leathery, Drumskin, Tympanic, Hard)
    \n\nDescription:	Bowstring and large (wide) with an empty center; feels like the head of a drum. Felt with light pressure. Floating, large, and hard and resistant to pressure.

    \n\nIndications:	Hemorrhage, Damage of Yin, Great Blood Loss (severe diarrhea/hemorrhage)
    \n\nEtiology:	There is failure to fill the vessels by insufficient Ying and Blood causing Yang Qi to detach and float to the surface.
    Sources disagree on the \n\nDescription of this pulse, some say that the beats around the middle level are palpable(i.e. light or heavy pressure) and the beats at the middle level are impalpable. Bob Flaws says that "a pulse which is empty in the center is an extreme floating pulse which not only gets weaker when one presses down but disappears altogether. It only reappears again when pressure is released to the superficial level."
</item>
        <item>
    Ru Mai (Soft or Soggy)
